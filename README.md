# RimworldBackstoryChecker
A tool for modding rimworld, that checks for grammar resolver errors in all loaded BackstoryDefs.

Upon loading the game, if any erroring backstory is found, the following log will get generated:

All symbols under "found errors" are the ones malformed inside the description.
